# Recommendations for Processing Head CT Data

We will focus on aspects of quantitatively analyzing the CT data and
getting the data into a format familiar to most MRI neuroimaging
researchers. Therefore, we will not go into detail of DICOM reading
tools or imaging suites for radiologists, which are generally
proprietary and quite costly. Moreover, we will be focussing
specifically on non-contrast head CT data, though many of the
recommendations and software is applicable to images of other areas of
the body.
